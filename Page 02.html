        <p>Welcome to Page 02, and I'm going to introduce what I coded in February there!<br>
            </p>
        <h3>1. This Portfolio</h3>
        <p>Normally, a portfolio is a large, thin, flat case for loose sheets of paper such as drawings or maps. However, in computer science classes, portfolios serve as a record of events. This portfolio was started on February 12 and completed on June 20, and it records all the coding projects in this semester's computer science class.</p>
        <h3>2. "Language of the WOrld" Assignment</h3>
        <p>The "Language of the World" project started on February 20th, and its purpose is to introduce a programming language. In this project, I worked with Liam Rodrigs to introduce the less popular programming language Lua. We analyzed some Lua programs and made a poster</p>
        <h3>3. Gocobi Studying</h3>
          <p>Since February 23, I have been learning HTML and Javascript on Gocobi under the guidance of Mr. Jamieson. Although this experience is less than two weeks, I have learned a lot of HTML knowledge, such as styles, css and script.</p>
