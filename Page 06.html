        <p>Welcome to Page 06! Here I'm going to introduce my codings in June!</p>
        <h3>1. Exploring China Website</h3>
        <p>Exploring China Website is the third website I made in Computer Science, and it is also the one I am most satisfied with. In this website, I introduced famous mountains, tourist cities, rare animals and historical sites in China. I also made a header and used pictures to decorate the website. Although this website is not very fancy, I think it is the most successful website I made in Computer Science Course.</p>

          <br><h3>2. Strings Presentation</h3>
        <p>I went to the University of Waterloo to attend EMACS math (and CS) summer camp at the end of May (almost math, but a little CS), so I missed a week of classes. Therefore, I had very little time to complete my part of the string presentation, so it is not very refined. However, in the process of making the presentation, I learned some string-related knowledge, such as string searching and temporal literals, and I also worked in a group with Liam Rodrigs, Daniel Wasiluk and Alp Mumcu.</p>

       <br><h3>3. HTML/JavaScript Interactions</h3>
       <p>This is also part of lesson 7.4, and I think this lesson is very interesting, so I not only made the 3 buttons required by Mr. Jamieson, but also made 3 bonus buttons. In this assignment, I learned to connect HTML pages with JavaScript, and also learned the purpose of eventListener. You can click the link below to check it out. I think this assignment is very interesting.</p>

        <br><br><h3>4. Blackjack Website</h3>
            <p>Since June 14, I have worked with Liam Rodrigs and Yann Armstrong in a team to create a Blackjack Website, which is also a very interesting website. In this website, players can gamble their $100, and when the gamble is successful, the player will get more money. In any case, I will never gamble, because I know that the probability of gambling success is a small event, and gambling is very addictive, which is not a good thing. As a student, I urge everyone to stay away from gambling, cherish money, and cherish life. If you are addicted to gambling, please give up gambling and become a statistician to study the probability problems in gambling. If you are addicted to playing games, please give up games and become a computer scientist to develop games.</p>

              <br><br><h3>5. This Portfolio, Again, Haha...</h3>
              <p>Many of the contents were created by me on June 20th, but I made them with my heart. I described in detail every coding from February to June and provided links. I hope you can appreciate my serious attitude.</p>
